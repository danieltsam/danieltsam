# Hi, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an IT student with a bit of experience in **Windows system administration** and **virtualization**. Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into **Linux**, **DevOps**, **Cloud technologies**, and **Cybersecurity**. Iâ€™m passionate about learning how systems work, automating tasks, and improving efficiency and reliability.
<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes create 'vibe-coded' projects just to see how far I can push them, mostly for fun, as Iâ€™m more interested in systems, cloud, DevOps, and cybersecurity than traditional software engineering. A lot of my repos will end up being these dodgy projects :)

## What I'm Interested in Learning ðŸ“š
 **Linux Administration** (Getting hands-on with the command line)<br/>
 **Cloud Computing** (Exploring AWS, Azure, and other cloud tools)<br/>
 **DevOps** (CI/CD, automation, and containerization)<br/>
 **Cybersecurity** (Learning about system security and best practices)<br/>

###### I love figuring out how things work under the hood and constantly improving processes. There's always something new to learn, and as nerdy as it sounds, I'm excited to continue learning about IT!

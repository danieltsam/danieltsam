# Hi, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an IT student with a bit of experience in **Windows system administration** and **virtualization**. Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into **Linux**, **DevOps** and **Cloud technologies**. Iâ€™m passionate about learning how systems work, automating tasks, and improving efficiency and reliability.
<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes create 'vibe-coded' projects just to see how far I can push them, mostly for fun, as Iâ€™m  not super interested in traditional software engineering. A lot of my repos will end up being these dodgy projects :)
